The TAG had a virtual face-to-face hosted on Kronos (because why not) the week of January 25th, 2021. This meeting consisted of breakout sessions distributed across 3 time zone groups to accomodate our distributed membership. Our focus was largely on progressing Design Review issues along with updates to our Design Principles, Security & Privacy Questionnaire and Ethical Principles documents.

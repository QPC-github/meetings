こんにちはTAG!

I'm requesting TAG presence at the following virtual meeting during TPAC 2020:

  - Group: [group name]
  - Topic: [topic]
  - Specification URL: [spec url]
  - Explainer (containing user needs and example code)¹: [url]
  - GitHub issues (if you prefer feedback filed there): [url]
  - Agenda of your meeting: [url]
  - Preferred date and timeframe: [at least a day is required]

When the meeting agenda and specific room has been finalized, we request the groups to note these details as comments in this issue.

Please note that we will not officially register as observers, as the assignee for presence will not be decided until all the groups have sent in requests.

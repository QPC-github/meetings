Present: Kenneth, Dan, Alex, Travis, Yves  
Regrets: David, Hadley, Lukasz, Peter

Web components discussion. Agreement we should do something here; particularly regarding components that are prototypes for standards-track designs. I.e., how we might help encourage components to be designed in an observable way to build evidence for inclusion in standards.

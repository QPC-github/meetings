### Developer Meetup opportunity

Evening of July 24th or 25th (25th preferred)

I have a tentative reservation at the "Microsoft Reactor", a space reserved for developer meetups in Seattle for us to host a "meet the TAG" event. It'll be in the same building as our F2F--a large open space that can easily accomodate 150 people, or squeeze in 300 if needed. The venue is brand-new--they had their [open house](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/reactor-seattle-community-open-house-tickets-43260302730) March 29, 2018!

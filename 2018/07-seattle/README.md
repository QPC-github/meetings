### Developer Meetup @ Microsoft Reactor space

Event page: https://ti.to/w3c-tag/meet-the-tag-seattle

Date/Time: Thursday evening, July 26th from 6 - 9pm

I've spoken with my TC39 contact, and they've indicated they would be excited to join us for this meetup. (Next steps, share the event page and collaborate on talks/topics.)

We have a reservation at the "Microsoft Reactor", a space reserved for developer meetups in Seattle for us to host a "meet the TAG" event. It'll be in the same building as our F2F--a large open space that can accomodate 100 people. The venue is brand-new--they had their [open house](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/reactor-seattle-community-open-house-tickets-43260302730) March 29, 2018!

# Distributed remote F2F
## week of 2020 May 18-22
## *** DATES NOT YET CONFIRMED ***

The AC Meeting [has been cancelled in favor of a virtual meeting](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2020JanMar/0025.html), and we're doing the same.

We had originally been planning to do the Wednesday-Friday following the AC meeting.  For a distributed face-to-face we might want slightly more days (though probably 4 and not 5, due to weekends), with slightly less time per day.  Does this mean we'll have problems with our times intersecting with the distributed AC meeting, and want to use a different week?


Some possible schedules for breakout timeslots could be:

#### Australia/Asia/Europe 3-hour slot

| Time                | Location        |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| 06:30-09:30 Mon-Thu | UTC             |
| 07:30-10:30 Mon-Thu | UK              |
| 08:30-11:30 Mon-Thu | France, Denmark |
| 15:30-18:30 Mon-Thu | Japan           |
| 16:30-19:30 Mon-Thu | Sydney          |

#### Europe/US 3-hour slot

NOTE: If we continue to use the same week as the AC meeting, then the start of this slot has a half-hour overlap with the end of the [AC meeting session time-slot](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/tag/2020Apr/0000.html).

| Time                | Location            |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 14:30-17:30 Mon-Thu | UTC                 |
| 07:30-10:30 Mon-Thu | California, Seattle |
| 15:30-18:30 Mon-Thu | UK                  |
| 16:30-19:30 Mon-Thu | France, Denmark     |

#### US/Australia/Asia 3-hour slot

| Time                        | Location            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 22:30 Mon-Thu-01:30 Tue-Fri | UTC                 |
| 07:30-10:30 Tue-Fri         | Japan               |
| 08:30-11:30 Tue-Fri         | Sydney              |
| 15:30-18:30 Mon-Thu         | California, Seattle |

#### Possible plenary timeslot (if needed)

If we need a plenary timeslot we could use something like this (which matches our teleconference time, but runs 15 minutes longer).  It ends 15 minutes before the first breakout slot above.  The disadvantages are that it's relatively early for Europe (who have to deal with running late the evening before) and especially that it's quite late for California (leaving only an 8 hour and 15 minute gap until the first breakout start the next morning).

So if we want breakouts like the above, it might be better to avoid having a plenary, perhaps by having an extended plenary time in adjacent weeks.

| Time                | Location        |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| 05:00-06:15 Tue-Thu | UTC             |
| 06:00-07:15 Tue-Thu | UK              |
| 07:00-08:15 Tue-Thu | France, Denmark |
| 14:00-15:15 Tue-Thu | Japan           |
| 15:00-16:15 Tue-Thu | Sydney          |
| 22:00-23:15 Mon-Wed | California      |

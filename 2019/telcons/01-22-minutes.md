Agenda:

## [<link> rel="modulepreload"](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/213) @slightlyoff

Travis: looked at the updated explainer--seemed an improvement over the last one.

Travis: satisified with Domenic's response on diff between it and import maps.

David: Good topic to try and close out at F2F?


## [IndexedDB Transaction Explicit Commit API](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/316) @cynthia @kenchris


Kenneth: We finished this last week?

Sangwhan: Our main point of feedback was there was 'commit' and we wanted to call it 'forcecommit'? I'm OK with either one. Looked over a variety of other APIs in other platforms...

Kenneth: not all platforms do auto-commit though right?

Sangwhan: It depends :-)

Kenneth: will leave an addition comment.

## [Trusted Types](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/198) @cynthia @slightlyoff @hadleybeeman @travisleithead @plinss

Peter: mwest asked to re-open and take a look--there have been changes...

Travis: Haven't looked yet. Can keep it for the f2f.

Peter: bumping to F2F.

## [User Activation API](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/300) @dbaron @hadleybeeman

David: We "discussed" this before Christmas... Probably needs a deep-dive (more than 30 mintues).

## [Review MathML](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/313) @cynthia @slightlyoff @dbaron

Kenneth: restarting a community group?

Sangwhan: the repository was deleted, then re-added--and no one noticed ;)

Travis: posted a link to a response on the issue in a Google Doc (link in Slack). Has anyone other than Alice seen this?

Tess: Pretty good overall. Would love to see Gap analysis for CSS/MathML?

Alice: How would the gap be useful outside of MathML, if any?

Tess: Tables could be relevant?

Sangwhan: Accessibility is hard for Math (hard to read out). Not sure MathML provides an out-text or long-desc equiv.

Alice: Been awhile for me. When asking teammates, they said MathJax is really good at rendering as Braille and spoken feedback. Additional some non-web-based tools do a good job. Wondering what scenarios folks would use it?

Sangwhan: MathJax has little to do with MathML. Inside the a11y tree it's not.

Alice: MathJax provides its own assistive version. Also has hidden content that provides the MathML.

Travis: propose moving to F2F. I'll try to incorporate Tess' feedback, and we can try to push public at the F2F.

## [IntersectionObserver V2](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/328) @slightlyoff @dbaron

David: Haven't yet followed up on my ask...

Peter: Punting to next week.

Tess: I will ask Simon how I think and feel.

David: Note there's a V1 and V2.

## [TextEncoderStream and TextDecoderStream](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/282) @cynthia @kenchris @travisleithead

Peter: currently pending external feedback.

Travis: Have an outstanding 'subclassing' issue. Should probably wait to the F2F.

## [OffscreenCanvas new commit() and DedicatedWorker.requestAnimationFrame](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/288) @slightlyoff @dbaron @travisleithead

Travis: I might ping Ken Russell to see if they have made progress?

## [Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS) CR](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/234) @cynthia @torgo @hadleybeeman

Peter: do we have a wrap-up for this?

Sangwhan: May need to check at F2F?

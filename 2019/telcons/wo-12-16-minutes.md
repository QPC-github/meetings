### [JS Self-Profiling API](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/366) - @dbaron, @kenchris

Picking this back up from Tokyo...

[reviewing latest activity on the issue]

Dave: should we close it?

Ken: I'm OK with closing it.

Tess: looking at it... doed profiling info include line & column for stack entries?

Dave: yes.

Tess: in webkit we only calculate that when the inspector is open and it could be expensive...  implementation wise that could be a performance regression.. Worth considering.

Ken: they mentioned that it's some overhead.

[resolved to close]

### [Proliferation of manifests at W3C](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/423) - @kenchris, @lknik

Migrated this issue to design principles.

Dan: a good principle might be - if your thing requires a manifest then think about using one of our fine existing manifests before you create a new manifest.

Tess: We may not get down to One True Manifest, but we can at least discourage a proliferation of them.

### [WebSocketStream](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/394) - @dbaron, @kenchris

Ken: we haven't heard back based on our comments...

[changed to pending external feedback]

Dan: I think we're done here.

Hadley: will close.

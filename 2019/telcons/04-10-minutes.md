Agenda:

* Issue Triage
* [User Activation Delegation through postMessages](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/347) - @hober, @alice, @plinss

Alice: User activation started out as this user made a gesture, and then turned into checked whether an even had a user gesture, as part of user interventions. For auto play that turned into checking whether something had ever had a user gesture.

Then ideas that when you check something whether it had a user gesture, then it would reset. Also ideas about batching user gestures/activations together in one event.

Kenneth: For dedicated workers in DAS we force users to ask for permission (static method) on the main thread and the worker will only be allowed to use the feature if it was granted on the main tread via the permissions API.

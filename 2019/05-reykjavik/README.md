### Accomodation Tips

Downtown Reykjavík is a 30 minutes walk, or a 10-15 minute bus ride. Bus 11, 13, and 111 go to the meeting venue. The live status of the buses (of the entire city) can be checked [here](https://www.straeto.is/en).

There is one hotel nearby, for those who really do not want to travel downtown.
